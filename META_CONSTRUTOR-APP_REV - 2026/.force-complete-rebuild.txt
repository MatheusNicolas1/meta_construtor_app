Force complete rebuild to fix React duplication
Timestamp: 2025-11-07T09:33:00Z

Changes applied:
1. Simplified devRefreshPreamble (no longer needed with vite.config fixes)
2. Vite config already has dedupe for react/react-dom
3. optimizeDeps.force is set to true
4. This file triggers a complete rebuild

Instructions:
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear all caches
- The React duplication error should be resolved
