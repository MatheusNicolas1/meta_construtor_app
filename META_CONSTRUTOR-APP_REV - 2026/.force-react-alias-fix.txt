Force React single instance via aliases
Timestamp: 2025-11-19T20:42:00Z

This fix:
1. Removes dynamic cacheDir (was causing multiple cache directories)
2. Adds explicit React aliases to node_modules/react and react-dom
3. Forces Vite to use ONLY these paths for React

This ensures only ONE React instance exists in the bundle.
The aliases override any cached versions.
