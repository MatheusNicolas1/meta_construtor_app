Force React import consistency fix
Timestamp: 2025-11-19T21:48:00Z

Fixed ThemeProvider to use direct named imports instead of namespace imports:
- Changed from: import * as React from "react"
- Changed to: import { createContext, useContext, useState, useEffect, ReactNode } from "react"

This ensures consistent React usage and prevents duplicate React instances.
