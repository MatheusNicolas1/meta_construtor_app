Disable React Fast Refresh completely
Timestamp: 2025-11-08T00:45:00Z
- Removed public/@react-refresh.js (to avoid shadowing Vite virtual module)
- Vite plugin react with fastRefresh disabled (cast as any)
- index.html preamble removed and cache-busted entry (refresh-disabled-final-3)
Notes: HMR will fall back to full reloads in dev.
