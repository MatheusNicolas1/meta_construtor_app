Force complete Vite rebuild - React single instance fix
Timestamp: 2025-11-19T20:39:20Z

This file forces Vite to:
1. Clear ALL cached dependencies
2. Rebuild React with proper deduplication
3. Fix "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" error

The error occurs when multiple React instances exist in the bundle.
This rebuild ensures only one React instance is used.
