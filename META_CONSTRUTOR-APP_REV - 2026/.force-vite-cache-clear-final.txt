Force Vite complete cache rebuild - React instance fix
Timestamp: 2025-11-18T13:00:00Z

Changes applied:
- Added optimizeDeps.include with react, react-dom, and react/jsx-runtime
- Added optimizeDeps.force to rebuild dependencies
- Added build.commonjsOptions for better module resolution
- Kept dedupe configuration for react and react-dom

This forces Vite to:
1. Pre-bundle React packages explicitly
2. Clear and rebuild the dependency cache
3. Use a single React instance across the entire app
4. Handle CommonJS modules properly

The "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')" error should now be resolved.
