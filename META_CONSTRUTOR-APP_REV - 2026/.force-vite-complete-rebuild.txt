Force Vite complete rebuild - React single instance fix
Timestamp: 2025-11-20T01:06:00Z

Problem: Multiple React instances causing "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')"
Root cause: Inconsistent React imports (import React vs import * as React)

Solution:
1. Added optimizeDeps.force: true to force complete dependency rebuild
2. This will force Vite to clear all cached chunks and rebuild with single React instance
3. Kept dedupe and aliases to ensure only one React instance is used

This forces a complete fresh rebuild of all dependencies.
