VITE CONFIG - FINAL FIX
======================

Removed all custom optimizations that were causing React Fast Refresh to break:
- Removed optimizeDeps.force
- Removed dedupe configuration
- Removed custom cacheDir
- Removed explicit jsxRuntime configuration
- Simplified to minimal working config

This should restore normal React Fast Refresh functionality.

User should do a hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear browser cache.
